Adds Sasuke to Slay the Spire as a character.

Fight your way up the Spire with Lightning in hand, Curses on your back, and Fireballs ready to go.

Major themes:
- Dark and Lightning (e.g. Amaterasu and Chidori Stream)
- Debuffs (e.g. Genjutsu)
- Exhaust (e.g. Dragon Flame)
- Scry (e.g. Sharingan)
- Self-harm (e.g. Tsukuyomi)
- Status and Curse cards (e.g. Snake Hands)

Character art from Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing, card art from the anime, and relic art reworked from base-game by me.
